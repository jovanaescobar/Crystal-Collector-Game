# Instructions:

- Each colored crystal will equal a random number between 1-12.

- Each game round a randomized target number between 19-120 will be generated.

- Your goal is to click the crystals wisely, as each click will add the crystals randomized point value to your current score.

- If you succesfully manage to equal the target number, you win, and you will accumulate a winning point.

- If your current score goes above the target number, you lose, and you will accumulate a losing point.

- At the start of each new game round:

    * The crystals will reset to a new point value.
    * The target number will reset.
    * Your current score will reset.
